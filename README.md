# ðŸ“˜ Data Types and Variables in Java

## ðŸ”¹ Variables
- A **variable** is a named memory location used to store data.
- It allows us to reuse and manipulate data in a program.

### âœ… Rules for Naming Variables
1. Must begin with a letter, `_`, or `$`.
2. Cannot be a keyword (e.g., `int`, `class`).
3. Case-sensitive (`age` and `Age` are different).
4. Should be meaningful (e.g., `studentName` instead of `sn`).

**Example:**
```java
int age = 20;  
String name = "Diksha";  
double salary = 35000.50;
